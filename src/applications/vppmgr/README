VPP Code Manager
Developed with web2py.

To customize your database and email settings, clip this snippet and
save it as modules/app_config.py:

# local application settings
from gluon.storage import Storage
app_settings = Storage()

app_settings.database_uri = 'sqlite://vpp.sqlite'
app_settings.author = 'username'
app_settings.domain = 'example.com'
app_settings.email_server = 'smtp.gmail.com:587'
app_settings.email_sender = 'username@gmail.com'

# This login:password combination is also used to log into the
# user's Google Docs:
app_settings.email_login = 'username@gmail.com:password'

# This is the Google Spreadsheet that contains the list of apps we manage:
app_settings.app_spreadsheet_name = '_iOS Applications'

# This is the Google Docs collection name that the VPP spreadsheets
# from Apple are loaded into:
app_settings.vpp_coll_name = 'iOS VPP Codes'

# If no user is specified as owning a particular VPP code, this will be used:
app_settings.default_vpp_user = 'username@example.com'

# Where the auth_user.csv and device.csv files will be found (see below):
app_settings.populate_folder = '/Users/user/project/src/applications/vppmgr/private/'

Setup also requires the presence of two csv files in the populate_folder
to populate the auth_user and device tables

Required header line for auth_user.csv file:
first_name,last_name,email,password

Required header line for device.csv file:
name,asset_number,serial_number,apple_device_id,location,room,user
