vppmgr

This is a web2py project.  Skeleton for the source tree was generated by
gen-web2py-project.sh script courtesy of Wraith Monster:

The basic idea is that you get VPP code spreadsheets from Apple, then
upload these as Google spreadsheets and add them to a Google Docs
collection (folder).  In addition, another Google spreadsheet
provides a list of apps that are managed (both free and apps that
have VPP codes or not), together with their iTunes download links
and group information for organizing the apps.

The web application will find available VPP codes from the VPP code
spreadsheets that match a list of apps, and update the spreadsheets
to indicate the the codes have been deployed.

The application then sends an email to the user is with the VPP redemption 
links for the specified apps if they are available, or else a link to the 
(non-discount) iTunes store page for the app.
